  <h1>🌍 How to Contribute to the Atlas of People and Place</h1>

  <p>Welcome! This guide takes you from the starting line (opening the Atlas) to the finish line (saving your contribution so it appears on the map).</p>

  <h2>1. Open the Atlas</h2>
  <p>Use this link: <a href="https://glenachulish.github.io/atlas/">Open the Atlas</a>. On mobile, it opens directly in your browser. The map centres on Scotland — zoom and pan to your area.</p>

  <h2>2. Find Your Place</h2>
  <p>Zoom in to the location you know, or use the search bar. You can also tap the <b>locate me</b> button to jump to your current location.</p>

  <h2>3. Start with a Photo 📸</h2>
  <p>Take a photo while standing at the site. On mobile, photos are geotagged automatically. In the popup, choose <i>Add image</i> to upload. The photo is stored in Wikimedia Commons and linked to the map.</p>

  <h2>4. Answer the Question ✍️</h2>
  <p>Each feature asks a short question (e.g. “What is this historic site?”). Type your answer, or choose from presets if available.</p>

  <h2>5. Tags Behind the Scenes 🏷️</h2>
  <p>Your answer automatically adds the correct OpenStreetMap tag (like <code>historic=castle</code>). You don’t need to know the syntax.</p>

  <h2>6. Save Your Edit 💾</h2>
  <p>Click <b>Save</b>. Your contribution is written into OpenStreetMap and will appear live in the Atlas within minutes.</p>

  <h2>7. Check and Share 🔗</h2>
  <p>Refresh to see your contribution. Share the Atlas link with friends or groups so they can add their knowledge too.</p>

  <h2>Tips</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Be specific: “Battle of Bannockburn site” is more useful than “Historic site.”</li>
    <li>Portrait photos display better on mobile.</li>
    <li>Check the marker is in the right place.</li>
    <li>Add links (Wikipedia, local history sites) if relevant.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Every photo, tag, and detail helps build a bilingual, open resource for everyone.</p>
