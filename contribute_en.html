  <h1>🌍 How to Contribute to the Atlas of People and Place</h1>

  <p>Welcome! This guide shows you how to add your knowledge and photos to the Atlas. Edits are saved automatically once you’re logged in — there is no separate “Save” button anymore.</p>

  <h2>1. Open the Atlas</h2>
  <p>Use this link: <a href="https://glenachulish.github.io/atlas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Open the Atlas</a>. The map centres on Scotland — zoom and pan to your area.</p>

  <h2>2. Log in</h2>
  <p>Click <b>Log in</b> at the top right and sign in with your OpenStreetMap account. Without logging in, your edits won’t be saved.</p>

  <h2>3. Find Your Place</h2>
  <p>Zoom to the location you know, or use the search bar. You can also tap the <b>locate me</b> button to jump to your current location.</p>

  <h2>4. Add Details ✍️</h2>
  <p>Click on a point (or add a new one). A panel will open with questions. Type a name, description, or other details. As soon as you leave the field, your edit is uploaded automatically.</p>

  <h2>5. Add a Photo 📸</h2>
  <p>
    - Export your photo from your phone or computer.<br/>
    - Upload it to <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:UploadWizard" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wikimedia Commons</a> (you’ll need to be logged in there too).<br/>
    - Copy the image link from Commons.<br/>
    - Paste it into the “Add a photo” field in the Atlas.<br/>
    - The photo will then appear in the map popup.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Check and Share 🔗</h2>
  <p>Refresh the map to see your contribution. Share the Atlas link with friends or groups so they can add their knowledge too.</p>

  <p>Every photo, tag, and detail helps build a bilingual, open resource for everyone.</p>
